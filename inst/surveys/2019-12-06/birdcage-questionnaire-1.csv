This may be regarding the birdcage user interface, the tweetio R library we explored this week, or the tool and programming training you have received. This is a quote we would like to provide to our sponsor that describes the value of the CORE Lab's work on this effort."

",The course was excellent; I do not think there is anything to improve on. ,"The tool was easier to use and better than other dashboards embedded open source research tools such as PULSE and PANTERA. As well, it was easier to use and had the ability to pull data directly into other forms such as JSON or CSV formats. The tool exceeds all my expectations. "

Without repetition, learning R would be practically impossible. Brendan made it less painful to grasp and the programming skills enable me to automate tasks more effectively. The birdcage interface is very user friendly. The added feature of the column viability tab within birdcage is a huge relief when it comes to filtering out pertinent results."

","Multiple Platforms (VK, OK, SINA WEIBO, FACEBOOK), Dictionary of Terms Used (bin is what? Entity is what? etc.)","The Birdcage application will assist in being able to quickly filter data in a user-friendly fashion, especially for the users who are less code-literate. The training provided on R has given me the capability to vastly increase data-sifting autonomy in my workflow, increase  granularity in creating and auditing operational products, and enabled me to be an even greater force multiplier. The class discussion also resulted in suggestions that may improve operational research methodology."
